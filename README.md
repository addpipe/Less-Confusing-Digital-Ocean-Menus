# Less-Confusing-Digital-Ocean-Menus
A simple Chrome extension that makes the Digital Ocean menus less confusing for those using Teams:

* `Settings` and `Notifications` moved from the top right drop down menu to the top left menu where they belong (together with all the other account level sections)
* `Settings > Notifications` renamed to `Settings > E-mail subscriptions`  which is where it takes you
* Had to rename `Notifications` to `Notf` and use a regular (non bold) font since the new `Monitoring BETA` menu items takes a lot of space
