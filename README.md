# Less-Confusing-Digital-Ocean-Menus

I manage more than 100 DO droplets across several accounts & teams and DO's navigation always confused me.

This simple Chrome extension makes the Digital Ocean account menus less confusing:

1. Moves `Settings` and `Notifications` to the top menu where they belong with the other *account level* links
2. Renames `Settings > Notifications` to `Settings > E-mail subscriptions` which is where it actually takes you

**Update:** Hooray! In response to this extension Digital Ocean quickly implemented the 2nd change ([HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13884513) , [DO's update on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13885943) ).
