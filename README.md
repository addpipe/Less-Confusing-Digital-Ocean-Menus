# Less-Confusing-Digital-Ocean-Menus

I manage more than 100 DO droplets across many accounts and their navigation always confused me.

This simple Chrome extension makes the Digital Ocean account menus less confusing:

* Moves `Settings` and `Notifications` to the top menu where they belong with the other *account level* links
* Renames `Settings > Notifications` to `Settings > E-mail subscriptions` which is where it actually takes you
